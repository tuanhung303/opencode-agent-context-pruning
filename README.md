# Agentic Context Pruning (ACP)

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@tarquinen/opencode-acp.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tarquinen/opencode-acp)

Automatically reduces token usage in OpenCode by intelligently managing conversation context.

## Installation

Add to your OpenCode config:

```jsonc
// opencode.jsonc
{
    "plugin": ["@tarquinen/opencode-acp@latest"],
}
```

Using `@latest` ensures you always get the newest version automatically when OpenCode starts.

Restart OpenCode. The plugin will automatically start optimizing your sessions.

## How ACP Works

ACP uses multiple tools and strategies to reduce context size:

### Tools

**Discard** — Exposes a `discard` tool that the AI can call to remove completed or noisy tool content from context.

**Extract** — Exposes an `extract` tool that the AI can call to distill valuable context into concise summaries before removing the tool content.

### Strategies

**Deduplication** — Identifies repeated tool calls (e.g., reading the same file multiple times) and keeps only the most recent output. Runs automatically on every request with zero LLM cost.

**Supersede Writes** — Prunes write tool inputs for files that have subsequently been read. When a file is written and later read, the original write content becomes redundant since the current file state is captured in the read result. Runs automatically on every request with zero LLM cost.

**Purge Errors** — Prunes tool inputs for tools that returned errors after a configurable number of turns (default: 4). Error messages are preserved for context, but the potentially large input content is removed. Runs automatically on every request with zero LLM cost.

Your session history is never modified—ACP replaces pruned content with placeholders before sending requests to your LLM.

## Impact on Prompt Caching

LLM providers like Anthropic and OpenAI cache prompts based on exact prefix matching. When ACP prunes a tool output, it changes the message content, which invalidates cached prefixes from that point forward.

**Trade-off:** You lose some cache read benefits but gain larger token savings from reduced context size and performance improvements through reduced context poisoning. In most cases, the token savings outweigh the cache miss cost—especially in long sessions where context bloat becomes significant.

> **Note:** In testing, cache hit rates were approximately 65% with ACP enabled vs 85% without.

**Best use case:** Providers that count usage in requests, such as Github Copilot and Google Antigravity have no negative price impact.

## Configuration

ACP uses its own config file:

- Global: `~/.config/opencode/acp.jsonc` (or `acp.json`), created automatically on first run
- Custom config directory: `$OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR/acp.jsonc` (or `acp.json`), if `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` is set
- Project: `.opencode/acp.jsonc` (or `acp.json`) in your project's `.opencode` directory

### Commands

ACP provides a `/acp` slash command:

- `/acp` — Shows available ACP commands
- `/acp context` — Shows a breakdown of your current session's token usage by category (system, user, assistant, tools, etc.) and how much has been saved through pruning.
- `/acp stats` — Shows cumulative pruning statistics across all sessions.
- `/acp sweep` — Prunes all tools since the last user message. Accepts an optional count: `/acp sweep 10` prunes the last 10 tools. Respects `commands.protectedTools`.

### Turn Protection

When enabled, turn protection prevents tool outputs from being pruned for a configurable number of message turns. This gives the AI time to reference recent tool outputs before they become prunable. Applies to both `discard` and `extract` tools, as well as automatic strategies.

### Protected Tools

By default, these tools are always protected from pruning across all strategies:
`task`, `todowrite`, `todoread`, `discard`, `extract`, `batch`, `write`, `edit`, `plan_enter`, `plan_exit`

The `protectedTools` arrays in each section add to this default list.

### Config Precedence

Settings are merged in order:
Defaults → Global (`~/.config/opencode/acp.jsonc`) → Config Dir (`$OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR/acp.jsonc`) → Project (`.opencode/acp.jsonc`).
Each level overrides the previous, so project settings take priority over config-dir and global, which take priority over defaults.

Restart OpenCode after making config changes.

## Limitations

**Subagents** — ACP is disabled for subagents. Subagents are not designed to be token efficient; what matters is that the final message returned to the main agent is a concise summary of findings. ACP's pruning could interfere with this summarization behavior.
